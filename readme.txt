== Frequently asked questions ==

= I installed Matchchat, but I just get a message saying I haven't been authorised? =

We vet our partners to ensure that Matchchat will work best for them - one of the ways we do this is by authorising the URL of your blog (www.example.com).

Contact us at info@matchchat.co.uk and we'll get any problems sorted ASAP.

= I installed Matchchat, but I can't see Matchchat? =

Older versions of our Wordpress plugin would only show Matchchat on new posts so that existing comments could still be viewed. The reverse is now true, by default Matchchat appears on all posts and previous comments are hidden, but this can be changed from the Settings menu as described in the installation instructions.

= How do I update Matchchat? =

We update all the parts your audience sees from our servers, so you'll always have the latest features and the most stable version.

Sometimes, we'll update this plugin which will give you more features in the dashboard - we'll contact you whenever to do this and help you through the process.

== Screenshots ==

1. Commenting is easier than ever before!
